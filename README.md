Personal emotions

I'm a novice here, it's my first try working on github. Maybe I'll do some childish behavior here since there lived a little princess in my heart ~~  Honestly, I creat this repositroy just for storing my personal emotions which suddenly come to my mind. I regard the github not only a repository to share code, but also a place to share my feelings. Of cause you may think it's foolish but why not make coding more meaningful thing (*^__^*)
